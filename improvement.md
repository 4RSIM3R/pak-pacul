# SQLite Database Implementation with B+ Tree - Key Improvements

## Value Types (`value.rs`)

The database uses Unix timestamps as the foundation for all date and time operations, keeping the type system minimal and efficient.

**Supported Data Types:**
- `Null` - Represents absence of value
- `Integer` - Signed integers (i64)
- `Real` - Floating-point numbers (f64)
- `Text` - UTF-8 encoded strings
- `Blob` - Binary large objects
- `Boolean` - True/false values
- `Timestamp` - Unix timestamp-based datetime

This minimalist approach reduces complexity while covering all essential use cases for a relational database.

## Row Serialization (`row.rs`)

Implemented a custom binary serialization format instead of using `bincode` to eliminate serialization overhead and achieve optimal space efficiency.

### Performance Comparison

| Format | Calculated Size | Actual Size | Waste Ratio |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Custom Binary** | 17 bytes | 17 bytes | **1.00x** |
| bincode | 21 bytes | 30 bytes | 1.43x |

### Why bincode was inefficient:
- **Vec length prefix**: 8 bytes overhead
- **Option discriminants**: 1 byte per nullable field
- **Enum discriminants**: Additional bytes for each Value variant
- **Padding/alignment**: Potential extra bytes for memory alignment

The custom format eliminates these overheads by using a compact, schema-aware encoding that knows exactly what data to expect.

*bincode configuration tested:*
```rust
let config = bincode::config::standard()
    .with_fixed_int_encoding()
    .with_little_endian();
```

## Page Management (`page.rs`)

Introduced a **slot pointer array** architecture for efficient page management and lazy loading capabilities.

### Key Benefits

Instead of loading entire 4KB pages into memory, the system can work with lightweight metadata:

- **Page ID**: Unique identifier
- **Slot pointer array**: Maps logical positions to physical row locations
- **Next page ID**: For linked page traversal

### Memory Efficiency

```
Full page load:     4,096 bytes
Metadata-only load:   224 bytes
Memory savings:     ~94.5%
```

### Architecture Advantages

1. **Lazy Loading**: Row data is only read when actually needed
2. **Worker Queue Integration**: Lightweight metadata can be efficiently passed to background workers
3. **Reduced I/O**: Significant reduction in disk reads for index operations
4. **Better Caching**: More metadata can fit in memory simultaneously

This approach enables the database to handle much larger datasets efficiently by keeping the working set small and deferring expensive I/O operations until absolutely necessary.
